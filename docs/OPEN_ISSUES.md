# Open Issues — Decisions Needed

## Issue #1: Course Assignments Navigation
**Status:** Undecided
**Date Raised:** 2026-02-24

The `/admin/cohort-courses` (Course Assignments) section has no top-level navigation link. It is currently only accessible from the Class Show page via cohort course row links or the "+ Add Course" button.

**Options to consider:**
- Add a **Course Assignments** card to the Admin Dashboard
- Add it to a navigation menu
- Leave it as a sub-feature of the Class view (no top-level link needed)

**Context:** Course Assignments link a catalog course to a cohort section and assign an instructor/institution. Users may need to browse or manage all course assignments independently of the Class view.
